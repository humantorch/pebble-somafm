# SomaFM for Pebble
A fairly simple "Now Playing" app that shows the currently-playing track from any station at [SomaFM](http://somafm.com). Install on your Pebble by going to http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55a7f76374e429d266000040 or searching for "SomaFM" in the Pebble app store.

## Donate
No, not to me. SomaFM is ad-free and entirely listener-supported radio. [Toss them some money](http://somafm.com/support) and support some of the best music you'll find anywhere.
