## build info

## todo
* Set up my own hosted version of Somascrobbler
* Any suggestions? Totally open to feature ideas and pull requests.

No, not to me. SomaFM is ad-free and entirely listener-supported radio. [Toss them some money](http://somafm.com/support) and support some of the best music you'll find anywhere.
